Kong Upstream JWT Plugin
Copyright 2018 Optum

Project Description:
====================

The Kong Upstream JWT Plugin is a small, lua-based, Openrestly nginx module which injects a signed JWT header to into proxied requests’ HTTP headers. The purpose of this JWT is to provide API providers (backend APIs) with a means of cryptographically ensuring the requests they received have gone through a Kong API Gateway’s secure proxy; and were not issued or tampered with by a potentially malicious 3rd party.
